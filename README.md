# Installation
**Fluster isn't complete yet for being used! Feel free to compile it out and attempt to use it, rest assured, some stuff *may be* broken** 

# Features
- **Vanilla 🍦**: We make the whole experience of the version as intact as possible, making every single feature work without compromising the functionality of it as how it previously worked.
- **Lightweight 🪶**: Attempts to be as lightweight as possible, we used Rust
- **Open Source 🌸**: Fluster has an open-source mindest! We are open to recieve pull requests for addition of features or bug fixes.

# Roadmap
(this doesn't have any particular order and i can start or stop with any of this at any time..)

- [ ] LAN Server Browser
- [ ] Linux and MacOS clients support
- [ ] Automatic Updates for both clients & Fluster
